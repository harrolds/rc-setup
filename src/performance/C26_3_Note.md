C-26.3 — Final Supabase Policies Review (Initialization)

This step does NOT yet modify database code.
It establishes the policy review layer and required documentation files:

- RLS (Row Level Security) review scaffolding
- Privacy-level mapping: public / friends / private
- Storage rules audit table
- Write-scope boundary checklist
- Orphan prevention model
- Rate-limit audit placeholder

Actual Supabase policy changes follow once the full structure is validated.
